<i>I like to hustle and think </i>! Which is a great combo for software development! I have a passion for being creative while being challanged mentally, which is a lot of the reason for why I have been so drawn to the field. The never ending well of knowledge to explore in computer science and software development keeps me searching for more.

My love for JavaScript and React grew out of a fascination with the endless possibilities of front-end web development. The ability to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces using these technologies has always been a thrill for me. I enjoy working on challenging problems that require creative solutions, and I am always eager to learn new techniques and technologies to improve my skills.

My first experience working on a software team was while working in QA for an open source crypto mobile application startup. They knew I wanted to get into development and were looking to implement an automated testing framework into their application. I had very limited experience and they <i> <b>threw me into the deep end</b></i>. This was truly eye-opening. It gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of <b>clean code, professional git conventions, collaboration, communication, and teamwork in building great software.</b> I realized that software development is a highly collaborative process that requires everyone on the team to be working towards the same goal. This experience helped me develop a better appreciation for the contributions of my colleagues, and I learned how to better communicate my ideas and opinions to the team.

While my primary focus is on front-end development, I gained valuable experience in quality assurance (QA) testing. Working in QA has taught me the importance of troubleshooting and debugging, and has helped me develop a keen eye for identifying and solving issues in software applications. I believe that this experience has given me a unique perspective on software development, and has made me a more well-rounded developer overall.

As I begin my career in software development, I am excited to continue learning and growing in my skills and abilities. I believe that my passion for JavaScript and React, combined with my experience in QA and teamwork, make me an ideal candidate for a career in software development.
