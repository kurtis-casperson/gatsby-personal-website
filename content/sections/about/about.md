My love for software development grew out of a fascination with the endless possibilities of front-end web development. The ability to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces using these technologies has always been a thrill for me. <b>I enjoy working on challenging problems that require creative solutions, and I am always eager to learn new techniques and technologies to improve my skills.</b> The never ending sea of knowledge that is computer science and software development always keeps me exploring for more.

My first experience working on a software team was while working in QA for an open source crypto mobile application startup. They knew I wanted to get into development and were looking to implement an automated testing framework into their application. I had very limited experience and they <i> <b>threw me into the deep end</b></i>. This was truly eye-opening. It gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of <b>clean code, professional git conventions, collaboration, communication, and teamwork in building great software.</b> I realized that software development is a highly collaborative process that requires everyone on the team to be working towards the same goal. This experience helped me develop a better appreciation for the contributions of my colleagues, and I learned how to better communicate my ideas and opinions to the team.

While my primary focus is on front-end development, I gained valuable experience in quality assurance (QA) testing. Working in QA has taught me the importance of <b>meticulous troubleshooting and debugging</b>, and has helped me develop a keen eye for identifying and solving issues in software applications. This experience has given me a unique perspective on software development, and has made me a more well-rounded developer .

As I begin my career in software development, I am excited to continue learning and growing in my skills and abilities. My hustle attitude and passion for a clean finished product make me an ideal candidate for a career in software development.
