My passion for software development stems from the endless possibilities in this field. I thrive on tackling challenging problems and actively seek to learn new techniques and technologies.

My first experience in a software team was in QA for an open-source crypto mobile application startup, where I helped implement an automated testing framework. This opportunity deepened my understanding of collaboration and effective communication, highlighting the importance of teamwork in building great software. This experience helped me develop a better appreciation for the contributions of my colleagues, and I learned how to better communicate my ideas and opinions to the team.

My QA background has sharpened my troubleshooting and debugging skills, providing me with a unique perspective on software development and enhancing my ability to identify and resolve issues.

As I begin my software development career, I am eager to grow my skills and contribute to clean, polished products. My proactive attitude and commitment to quality make me a strong candidate in this field.
